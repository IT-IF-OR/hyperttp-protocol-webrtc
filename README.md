# @hyperttp/protocol-webrtc

A thin `HyperProtocol` adapter for the `"webrtc"` protocol. It maps typed client inputs to transport requests and incoming transport requests to an application handler. It is **not a session manager or a WebRTC transport**.

The package does not create `RTCPeerConnection` instances, negotiate connections, capture media, manage tracks, or open DataChannels. The application and its selected `HyperTransport` own those responsibilities. There is no WebRTC runtime implementation or runtime/`werift` usage in `src`.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 20 for the package's development tooling.
- Compatible `@hyperttp/types` and TypeScript peer dependencies (see `package.json`). HyperCore is supplied by the host application, not implemented here.
- A `HyperTransport` that can execute requests for `"webrtc"`; receiving requests also requires the host's inbound transport/core wiring.
- **DOM types for TypeScript consumers**, including server-side consumers: public types reference `RTCIceServer`, `RTCSessionDescriptionInit`, and `RTCIceCandidateInit`. Include `"DOM"` alongside your chosen ECMAScript library in `compilerOptions.lib`, for example `["ES2022", "DOM"]`. This is a compile-time requirement, not a requirement to run a browser or install a WebRTC runtime.

## Development checks

Run `bun install`, then use `bun run typecheck:shared` and `bun run typecheck:node`,
`typecheck:bun`, or `typecheck:deno` for the corresponding type environments.
Run `bun run test:node`, `test:bun`, or `test:deno` for runtime-verified smoke
tests, and `bun run test` for the full Vitest suite. Each runtime must be
installed separately. See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for details and limitations.

## Protocol instances

`WebRtcProtocol` is the default singleton with a sender and a receiver without an application handler. Use the factory for an independently configured protocol:

```ts
import {
  createWebRtcProtocol,
  WebRtcProtocol,
  type WebRtcServerHandler,
} from "@hyperttp/protocol-webrtc";

const handler: WebRtcServerHandler = (request) => ({
  status: 200,
  payload: { received: request.payload },
});

const protocol = createWebRtcProtocol({ handler });
const clientProtocol = WebRtcProtocol;
```

`createWebRtcProtocol({ handler?: WebRtcServerHandler } = {})` creates a protocol with its own `WebRtcSender` and `WebRtcReceiver`. Register the chosen protocol and a suitable transport using your host core's API. The factory does not register a transport or start a listener. Calling the receiver's `handle()` without a handler throws; the default singleton is not an echo server.

## Using protocol and transport together

```ts
import { HyperClient } from "hyperttp";
import { createWebRtcProtocol, webRtcControlHandler } from "@hyperttp/protocol-webrtc";
import { WebRtcTransport } from "@hyperttp/transport-webrtc";

const transport = new WebRtcTransport({ iceServers: [] }); // Local development only.
const client = new HyperClient(
  {
    protocols: [createWebRtcProtocol({ handler: webRtcControlHandler })],
  },
  transport,
);

const response = await client.webrtc.receive("webrtc://127.0.0.1:3001/signal");
if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`WebRTC request failed: ${response.status}`);
// await client.destroy();
```

The remote server must also configure an application handler. The optional exported
`webRtcControlHandler` acknowledges only `connect`/`stream` and returns 501 for other
actions. Use it explicitly for media-only endpoints; it is not authentication and
is not installed by default. Use a custom handler for data-channel messages.

In the browser, import `@hyperttp/transport-webrtc/browser` explicitly, or use a
bundler that honors the root package's `browser` export condition. The explicit
entry is the portable choice for tooling without browser-condition resolution.

`WebRtcServerInput.transportSessionId` reads the transport-supplied
`x-webrtc-session-id` header. Use it with `transport.getServerSession(id)` on the
server; `sessionId` remains independent application correlation data. Neither ID
is proof of identity.

## Server facade with typed services

```ts
import { HyperClient } from "hyperttp";
import { WebRtcProtocol, webRtcControlHandler } from "@hyperttp/protocol-webrtc";
import { WebRtcTransport } from "@hyperttp/transport-webrtc";

const client = new HyperClient({ protocols: [WebRtcProtocol] }, new WebRtcTransport());
const server = client.server({
  host: "127.0.0.1",
  port: 3001,
  services: { audit: (action: string) => console.log(action) },
});

server.webrtc.signal("/calls/signal", {
  // Optional: authorize raw signaling POST/DELETE before peer/media allocation.
  // authorize: async ({ request, services }) => verifySessionOwner(request),
  handler: ({ request, context, services }) => {
    services.audit(request.action);
    return webRtcControlHandler(request, context);
  },
});

await server.start();
// Remote peer: client.webrtc.receive("webrtc://127.0.0.1:3001/calls/signal")
// await server.close();
// await client.destroy();
```

Types come from the protocol's augmentation of `@hyperttp/types`; import the
protocol to get typed `request`/response. Services are inferred from the object
passed to `client.server()` and are never disposed by the facade. The existing
`client.server(port, { services })` form also works.

The `authorize` callback receives raw headers, method, URL and cancellation signal,
not a parsed SDP body. It runs for both POST and DELETE; return `false` to deny.
Verify session ownership as well as authentication. Exceptions deny access without
exposing their message. Handler/Core hooks are later DataChannel-stage processing,
not a replacement for signaling authorization. Without `authorize` the endpoint
remains public, preserving the low-level transport default.

One facade supports one literal signaling path, or REST routes, not both. Create
separate facades with separate ports for REST and WebRTC. Register routes before
`start()`; startup and close are idempotent. Port ranges are not implemented;
`port` remains a single signaling TCP port, separate from WebRTC media UDP ports.

## Client requests

The sender exposes these methods through the host core's `webrtc` namespace (`WebRtcClientMethods`):

| Method                                             | Input action  | Behavior                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `connect(peerUrl, options?, signal?)`              | `connect`     | Dispatch a connection request.                                         |
| `receive(peerUrl, options?, signal?)`              | `stream`      | Request a stream; defaults `receiveAudio` to `true` unless overridden. |
| `stream(peerUrl, localStream, options?, signal?)`  | `stream`      | Pass an opaque local stream handle to the transport.                   |
| `dataChannel(peerUrl, payload, options?, signal?)` | `datachannel` | Pass a payload to the transport.                                       |

These methods dispatch through `core.send()` and return `UniversalResponse`; they do not return a peer session or guarantee that ICE negotiation has completed. `WebRtcLocalStream` is a structural handle with `getTracks()`, not a capture or track-ownership abstraction.

Signaling actions `offer`, `answer`, and `candidate` use the same request path; there are no dedicated convenience methods for them:

```ts
import type { IHyperCore } from "@hyperttp/types";
import type { WebRtcInput } from "@hyperttp/protocol-webrtc";

// Supplied by the application, with the protocol and transport already registered.
declare const core: IHyperCore;
declare const offer: RTCSessionDescriptionInit;

const response = await core.send<WebRtcInput, unknown, "webrtc">({
  protocol: "webrtc",
  input: {
    action: "offer",
    peerUrl: "https://example.com/signaling",
    sessionId: "call-123",
    offer,
    timeout: 5_000,
  },
});

console.log(response.status, response.data);
```

The URL is interpreted by the selected transport; it does not select an HTTP plugin automatically.

## Transport and signaling contract

`WebRtcTransportRequest extends TransportRequest` describes the WebRTC-specific request metadata. `prepare()` builds a POST-shaped request with `protocol: "webrtc"`, the peer URL, JSON content type, an action/payload body, signaling fields, and transport options such as `iceServers`, `localStream`, receive flags, and `channelLabel`.

The signaling contract carries `offer`, `answer`, `candidate`, and `sessionId` through the relevant client/server request and response types. `sessionId` is application-supplied correlation data, not a session allocated or tracked by this package. The optional `iceGeneration` is an opaque, non-empty string of at most 256 characters, supplied by the application to correlate signaling across ICE restarts. Existing non-negative safe integer values are also accepted for compatibility; values retain their original type and are not generated, converted, or tracked by this adapter. Candidates retain their standard `usernameFragment` when supplied. For end-of-candidates, `candidate: { candidate: "" }` and `candidate: null` are both accepted and preserved; an omitted candidate remains invalid for the `candidate` action. The adapter does not generate SDP, apply descriptions, buffer ICE candidates, or validate signaling state.
With `@hyperttp/transport-webrtc`, these actions are application messages over an
already negotiated DataChannel. They do not control the transport's HTTP SDP
negotiation, which is owned by the transport.

`send()` checks `transport.supports("webrtc")` **if the method exists** and rejects a transport that reports no support; otherwise it checks the optional `protocols` list and delegates to `transport.execute()`. A transport without `supports` is not rejected merely for omitting that optional method.

`parse()` places the transport body in `UniversalResponse.data`, preserves `raw`, and sets `ok` for status codes 200–299. A non-2xx transport response is represented as `ok: false`, not automatically thrown as an exception. Transport errors propagate.

The receiver maps incoming bodies to `WebRtcServerInput`, invokes the configured handler, and maps its result back to a transport response (default status 200 and JSON content type). Malformed bodies, unknown/missing actions, invalid descriptions/candidates, and ambiguous peer headers are rejected with `INVALID_WEBRTC_SIGNAL` (status 400). An already-aborted server context is rejected before calling the handler.

**`x-peer-id` is metadata, not authentication.** The receiver reads it as `peerId` (falling back to `"unknown"`); this does not verify the caller's identity. Authentication, authorization, payload validation, trusted identity binding, and replay protection belong to the application/transport boundary.

Cancellation uses an `AbortSignal`; positive timeouts produce a timeout signal. The transport must honor that signal. Neither aborting a request nor a timeout implies closing a peer connection or stopping tracks.

## Out of scope

- Peer-session storage, lifecycle events, retries, reconnects, and hangup coordination.
- SDP negotiation, glare handling, ICE buffering, and STUN/TURN provisioning.
- Media capture, track cleanup, RTP/SRTP processing, and physical DataChannel I/O.
- Signaling servers, browser adapters, and server WebRTC runtimes.

## Development scripts

```bash
# From the monorepo root:
node scripts/workspaces.ts build protocol-webrtc
node scripts/workspaces.ts test protocol-webrtc

```

## Server namespace extension

`WebRtcRouteContext`, `WebRtcSignalOptions` and `WebRtcServerMethods` are exported
by `@hyperttp/protocol-webrtc`, not `hyperttp`. Importing the protocol loads its
`declare module "@hyperttp/types"` augmentation of `HyperServerProtocols`.
Register `WebRtcProtocol` (or `createWebRtcProtocol(...)`) in the client's
`protocols` configuration to provide the runtime `.webrtc` namespace. A type-only
import does not register the implementation.

The protocol owns path validation, signaling authorization and the typed handler;
Hyperttp owns startup, shutdown and the single-listener lifecycle.
